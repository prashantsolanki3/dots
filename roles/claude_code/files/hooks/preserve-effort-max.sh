# preserve-effort-max.sh — keep Claude Code pinned to "max" effort.
#
# Why: ~/.claude/settings.json gets rewritten by the Claude CLI whenever the
# user toggles plugins, edits permissions, or accepts a security prompt. These
# rewrites have historically dropped the `effortLevel` key (see Anthropic
# changelog: "Fixed `--effort` CLI flag being reset by unrelated settings
# writes on startup"). This hook restores it.
#
# Behaviour:
#   - Missing file               → create with {"effortLevel":"max"}
#   - Missing key                → add effortLevel: max
#   - Wrong value                → reset to max
#   - Already max                → no-op (mtime preserved)
#   - Malformed JSON             → exit 0 silently (don't clobber user data)
#
# Usage:
#   - Invoked from settings.json `hooks.SessionStart` on every Claude session.
#   - Safe to run manually:  ~/.claude/hooks/preserve-effort-max.sh
#
# Exit code: always 0. Hooks should never block session start; if we can't
# fix it, the user already has the same broken state they had before.
