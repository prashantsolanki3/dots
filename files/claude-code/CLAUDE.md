# Global Claude Code Rules

- Prefer CLI tools, scripts, and approved MCP servers over manual UI work.
- Do not commit plaintext secrets — use env files (.gitignore'd) or system keychain.
- Read the project's CLAUDE.md before starting any task.
- Never add Co-Authored-By lines to commit messages.

## Agent Teams

Agent teams are enabled. Use `claude --agent orchestrator` to start a continuous development session that picks up tasks from the project's GitHub Project board.

## Best Practices

- Use plan mode (`/plan`) before implementing complex features
- Use `/verify` to run the project's verification suite
- Use `/review` to self-review changes before creating a PR
- One concern per commit, format: `type(scope): description`
- Always read AGENTS.md and AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md in the project repo first
- Prefer worktree isolation for implementation work
